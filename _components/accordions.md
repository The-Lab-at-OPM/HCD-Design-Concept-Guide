      <h4>When to use the accordion component</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li><strong>If users will only need a few specific pieces of content within a page.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>If you have only a small space to display a lot of content.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h4>When to consider something else</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li><strong>If users need to see most or all of the information on a page.</strong> Use well-formatted text instead.</li>
        <li><strong>If there is not enough content to warrant condensing.</strong> Accordions increase cognitive load and interaction cost, as users have to make decisions about what headers to click on.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Usability guidance</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li><strong>Make the entire header selectable.</strong> Allow users to click anywhere in the header area to expand or collapse the content; a larger target is easier to manipulate.</li>
        <li><strong>Give interactive elements enough space.</strong> Make sure interactive elements within the collapsible region are far enough from the headers that users don’t accidentally trigger a collapse. (The exact distance depends on the device.)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="usa-heading">Accessibility</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Code header areas in the accordion as buttons.</strong> Using a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> assures that accordions are usable with both screen readers and the keyboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use aria-expanded on buttons to express an accordion’s default state.</strong> Buttons should state if they are expanded by default with <code>aria-expanded=<wbr>"true"</code>. The <code>aria-expanded=<wbr>"false"</code> attributes will be added to other buttons when the accordion is initialized by the JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use unique ids.</strong> Each button has a unique name <code>aria-controls=<wbr>"id"</code> that associates the control to the appropriate region by referencing the controlled element&rsquo;s <code>id</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The accordion uses javascript to set the <code>hidden</code> value of its content area.</strong> Each content area will have its <code>hidden</code> attribute set by the component, depending on its corresponding button&rsquo;s <code>aria-expanded</code> attribute. To ensure that your content is accessible in the event that the JavaScript does not load or is disabled, you should not manually set <code>hidden</code> on any of your content areas.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="usa-heading">Implementation</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Multiselectable accordion groups.</strong> Add the <code>aria-multiselectable="true"</code> attribute to any <code>usa-accordion</code> to create a multiselectable accordion group.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Default an accordion button to open.</strong> Add the <code>aria-expanded="true"</code> attribute to any <code>usa-accordion__button</code> to have that section open by default at page load.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="usa-heading">Package information</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
