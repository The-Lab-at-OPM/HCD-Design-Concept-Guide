      <h4>When to use the footer component</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li><strong>Big footer:</strong> Use the big footer when you want to replicate your site’s navigation scheme in the footer and offer newsletter signups.</li>
        <li><strong>Medium footer:</strong> Use the medium footer when you want to offer only a few footer links (for disclaimers, terms of service, etc.), social media icons, and contact information.</li>
        <li><strong>Slim footer:</strong> Use the slim footer when you only want to offer a few footer links and nothing else.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>When to consider something else</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li><strong>Medium and slim footers:</strong> Use the big footer when your footer has more than five links.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Usability guidance</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li><strong>Curate your footer.</strong> Footer links should point to popular content that might answer a visitor’s remaining questions. Links to disclaimers and legal content sometimes need to be in the footer, but try to minimize “disclaimer bloat” wherever possible.</li>
        <li><strong>The footer doesn’t need to mirror the header.</strong> Link grouping in the footer does not have to mirror link grouping in top level header navigation (especially if the navigation offers many more links than the footer can).</li>
        <li><strong>Include newsletter signup.</strong> Include the newsletter signup if one of your website’s goals is getting visitors to sign up for a newsletter.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid stale social media accounts.</strong> Link only to social media your agency updates frequently or uses to communicate with customers.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit contact information to email and phone.</strong> Important contact information should be limited to general email or phone numbers, which should be clickable links to dial from a mobile phone. Physical addresses should live on contact pages users can navigate to from the accordion links.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="usa-heading">Accessibility</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li><strong>Use tab focus.</strong> Code the navigation so that pressing the tab key moves focus from link to link in the navigation, even when the navigation has collapsed into an accordion.</li>
        <li><strong>Use accessible accordions.</strong> On small screens: when collapsed into an accordion, the navigation should also meet the accessibility requirements outlined in the "Accordion" section.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="usa-heading">Implementation</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
        <li>The social media icons used in the footer are from Font Awesome. To use additional icons, visit <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="usa-heading">Package information</h4>
      <ul class="usa-content-list">
