# Contributing to U.S. Web Design System Documentation

We’re so glad you’re thinking about contributing to a Technology Transformation Services (TTS) open source project! If you’re unsure about anything, just ask — or submit your issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is we’ll politely ask you to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

TTS is committed to building a safe, welcoming, harassment-free culture for everyone. We expect everyone on the TTS team and everyone within TTS spaces, including contributors to our projects, to follow the [TTS Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

We encourage you to read this project’s CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), [README](README.md) and its [Workflow](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/wiki/Workflow) process.

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository]( https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or [send us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).

## Issues and labels

To help us get a better understanding of the issue you’re submitting, follow our `ISSUE TEMPLATE` and the guidelines it describes in the template.

Also, here are some definitions around the labels we use to help us organize our issues:

### Category
* Accessibility
* Content Design
* DevOps
* Documentation
* Engineering
* Front end
* User Experience
* Visual Design

### Work Status
* **Abandoned:** Contributor no longer responsive in correspondence.
* **Accepted:** Reviewed and approved by core teammate and included on product roadmap.
* **Backlog:** A build up of work that’s been initially reviewed and correlating labels applied. It needs to be reviewed before moving to “Accepted”.
* **Blocked:** Not able to move forward with work due to conflict.
* **Completed:** Merged in and closed.
* **Help wanted:** Contributors open to claiming and tackling. Description and acceptance criteria have been written.
* **Idea:** New idea or request; team has yet to evaluate.
* **In progress:** Work that has been assigned and is currently being worked on.
* **Need more info:** There is not enough information in order to move forward. A team member may request more information from the submitter or do some research to find the necessary information.
* **On Hold:** Work is currently paused (or not able to move forward) due to conflict.
* **Review needed:** Pull request review needed.
* **Revisions needed:** Requires corrections based on team feedback.

### Priority
* **Blocker:** Needs immediate attention. Prevents the product from working if it were released in that state. (For example: build failing, tests not passing)
* **Critical:** A critical requirement without which it is unacceptable to stakeholders. Impacts the application’s functionality. (For example: feature not working in all browsers, content not accessible to screen readers)
* **Major:** A necessary but deferrable requirement that makes the product less usable but still functional. Does not impact the application’s functionality. (For example: typos)
* **Minor:** A nice feature to have if there are resources, but the product functions well without it. Also known as “could be betters.” (For example: feature requests, cosmetic enhancements)

### Type
* **Bug:** Error, failure, or flaw in the product.
* **Enhancement:** Modification of product to enhance performance or correct faults for items that already exist.
* **Maintenance:** Fixing product defects.
* **Question:** An inquiry asking for more information.
* **New:** A completely new, discrete unit added to the package.
