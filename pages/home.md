## <a href= "https://the-lab-at-opm.github.io/website/hcd-guide/design/">HCD Design Concept Guide</a>

Welcome to the Human-Centered Design Guide Series from the Lab at OPM! We're excited you're here. Before you get started, here are some details about the Guide Series. If you've already seen this information in our Github wiki, feel free to skip this section.

We're working to improve the HCD Guide Series, so we've iterated on the design of the HCD Design Concept Guide, creating a whole new look and feel. You can see the improved Guide via <a href= "https://the-lab-at-opm.github.io/website/hcd-guide/design/">this link.</a>

As always, let us know what you think by email at lab@opm.gov
